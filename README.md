# actixweb
**This is the backend for a task management service using Rust.**
Made using Actix
The main features of a backend framework are its Speed and DB integration because the UI/UX, buttons are handled by the frontend developer.
Rust makes the backend blazingly fast since it is a compiled language but also takes care of low-level problems like seg-faults etc.
**The next step for this project is to build a fully functional GUI library using [Dioxus.](https://dioxuslabs.com/)**
I strongly support Dioxus' motto of write once run everywhere.
